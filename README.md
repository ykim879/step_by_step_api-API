## Web Scrapping Basic
Web is a client and server system. 
For client to connect the server, they need URL, which identifies servers and resources, and HTTP for connection between clients and servers.
These days, servers provide API which is usually in Json format for clients to retrieve data.

## To Request the Data
To request the data we can either use urllib or request. For basic API, we will use request sine it is a higher interface which means it is easier to use.
To use request, you have to [pip](https://pypi.org/project/requests/2.7.0/).
```dash
pip install requests
```
